> 「In my brief academic career, I learned one thing... the more earnestly you delve, the more you realize the limits of human capability... — Unless you transcend humanity!!」

Hey, I'm Ifeng. I have a decent understanding of computer technology and I'm passionate about music and traveling. The human brain has its limits; within finite time and energy, it's difficult to grasp all the knowledge one desires. That's why we need "tools" and "skills" to transcend physical constraints. For me, writing is an incredibly effective method. I compile the knowledge I've absorbed into notes, enabling me to quickly revisit my thought process during review sessions. Once I've amassed a sufficient number of notes, I can gradually construct my own framework for a particular topic.

Most of the time, I use a personal note-taking tool to organize my thoughts. Blogging, on the other hand, provides a different sensation as it's a public platform. Although I mostly learn by reading articles from experts online, I believe that sharing my own insights, even if they're just modest achievements, can contribute positively to the community and help others.

Around 2017, Hugo was highly regarded among various static website generators. Over the following years, I predominantly used Markdown for writing and then deployed the static pages generated by Hugo onto GitHub Pages. During this period, I also developed my own themes, Dockerized the entire system, and established a rather convenient writing workflow.

However, ultimately, around 2022, I abandoned the static website generator + GitHub Pages approach in favor of the more convenient Ghost. The primary reason being the ability to write across devices seamlessly without the need for environment reconfiguration. Additionally, the ability to directly edit and preview changes on the web page saved a considerable amount of effort in generating articles and managing images. Even though I am a fervent Markdown enthusiast, I still desired to set up my blog in a cool and geeky manner. After exploring numerous alternative solutions, I still felt the necessity for a platform that allows immediate modification and updating of articles. Perhaps, in due time, I may stumble upon new tools again.
